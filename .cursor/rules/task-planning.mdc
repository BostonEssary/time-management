 When receiving Acceptance Criteria (AC) for a task, follow these steps for planning and execution:

1. Initial Analysis:
   - Break down the AC into distinct requirements
   - Identify any dependencies between requirements
   - Note any potential technical challenges or unknowns

2. Implementation Planning:
   - Determine the order of implementation based on dependencies
   - Identify which parts of the codebase will need to be modified
   - List any new files, models, or migrations needed
   - Consider test coverage requirements

3. Technical Approach:
   - Outline the specific changes needed for each requirement
   - Consider database schema changes if needed
   - Plan UI/UX changes if applicable
   - Identify potential performance implications

4. Risk Assessment:
   - List potential edge cases
   - Note areas that might need extra testing
   - Identify possible impacts on existing features

5. Execution Strategy:
   - Break down the work into smaller, manageable commits
   - Plan the testing approach (unit tests, integration tests)
   - Consider if any documentation updates will be needed

This structured approach ensures thorough understanding and efficient implementation of tasks while maintaining code quality and project standards.
